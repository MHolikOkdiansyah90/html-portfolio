<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am someone who likes playing games for that reason. I want to learn to
  program to be able to create my own games. I was born in Klaten city, a small
  town in Central Java. My hobby is football. I am very interested in learning
  to program for that reason. I started learning it from now, there are many
  things I have to learn. I hope I can succeed.

  My favorite football team since I was little is AC Milan. My favorite games
  that I play are stealth action games like Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell,
  Hitman for example. I also like the horror action game Resident Evil and other
  unique games that I like too.

<p>My favorite food is fried chicken, fried rice, meatballs and noodles</p>
